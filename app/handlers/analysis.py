    @apiDescription Calling this route will perform analysis on the video. When the analysis is done, an email will be sent to the project's user. This test consists of running object tracking on the video, and then running safety analysis on the results of the object tracking. When the analysis is complete, the system will produce a safety report for the intersection. (Due to the potentially long duration of testing, it is infeasible to return the results as a response to the HTTP request. In order to check the status of the testing and view results, see the Status group of messages.)

    @apiParam {String} identifier The identifier of the project to test configuration of.

    @apiSuccess status_code The API will return a status code of 200 upon success.

    @apiError error_message The error message to display.
